  <p>Passive income used to mean buying rental properties or investing six figures in the stock market. Not anymore. Today, a handful of well-designed apps let you earn money in the background — while you work, sleep, or binge your favorite show.</p>
  <p>But here's the catch: most "passive income app" lists are filled with junk. We tested dozens and narrowed it down to the ones that actually deposit real money into your account.</p>

  <h2>Top 10 Passive Income Apps Worth Your Time</h2>

  <h3>1. Acorns — Micro-Investing on Autopilot</h3>
  <p>Acorns rounds up your everyday purchases and invests the spare change into diversified portfolios. Over time, those pennies compound. Most users see 7-10% annual returns without thinking about it.</p>

  <h3>2. Fundrise — Real Estate Without the Hassle</h3>
  <p>Invest in commercial real estate starting at just $10. Fundrise pools your money with other investors to buy properties, and you earn quarterly dividends. Average annual returns hover around 8-12%.</p>

  <h3>3. Rakuten — Cashback on Purchases You Already Make</h3>
  <p>Shop through Rakuten's portal and earn 1-15% cashback at over 3,500 stores. It's not life-changing money, but $300-$600 per year for clicking one extra link is hard to beat.</p>

  <h3>4. Honeygain — Sell Your Unused Bandwidth</h3>
  <p>Honeygain pays you for sharing your internet connection. Install the app, let it run in the background, and earn $20-$50 per month. It uses minimal bandwidth and won't slow your connection.</p>

  <h3>5. Dividend Tracker Apps (M1 Finance)</h3>
  <p>M1 Finance lets you build a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks with no trading fees. Reinvest dividends automatically and watch compound growth do the heavy lifting.</p>

  <h3>6. Groundfloor — Short-Term Real Estate Lending</h3>
  <p>Lend money to real estate developers and earn 8-14% annual returns. Loans are short-term (6-12 months), so your money isn't locked up for years.</p>

  <h3>7. Ibotta — Grocery Cashback</h3>
  <p>Scan your grocery receipts and earn cashback on everyday items. Power users report saving $50-$100 per month on groceries they'd buy anyway.</p>

  <h3>8. Arrived Homes — Fractional Rental Properties</h3>
  <p>Own a piece of rental property for as little as $100. Arrived handles everything — tenants, maintenance, management. You collect quarterly rental income.</p>

  <h3>9. Fetch Rewards — Points for Every Receipt</h3>
  <p>Snap any receipt and earn points redeemable for gift cards. No clipping coupons, no specific brands required. It takes 10 seconds per receipt.</p>

  <h3>10. Webull — Free Stock Trading with Cash Bonuses</h3>
  <p>Webull offers free stock trades and frequently gives free stocks for signing up. Build a dividend portfolio with zero commission costs.</p>

  <h2>How to Maximize Your Passive Income</h2>
  <p>Don't rely on a single app. Stack 3-4 apps together: one for investing, one for cashback, one for real estate. Small streams add up to a river. The key is consistency — set everything to autopilot and let time do the work.</p>

  <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>Passive income apps won't make you rich overnight. But they will put your money and time to work in ways that compound over months and years. Start with one or two apps today, automate what you can, and check back in six months. You'll be glad you started.</p>
